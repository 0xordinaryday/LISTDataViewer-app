    <string name="about_spiel">This app displays data from The LIST (Land Information System Tasmania),
        see <a href="https://www.thelist.tas.gov.au/app/content/home">here</a>. Specifically, the app
    displays data from the public ArcGIS REST Service which can be found
        <a href="http://services.thelist.tas.gov.au/arcgis/rest/services">here</a>. Data provided via
        The LIST is subject to terms and conditions set out
        <a href="http://listdata.thelist.tas.gov.au/public/LISTWebServicesTermsConditions.pdf">here</a>.
        Note this link leads to a PDF file of the terms and conditions.\n\n

        The app also displays data from the Mineral Resources Tasmania Web Feature Service found
        <a href="http://www.mrt.tas.gov.au/portal/wfs">here</a>.

        of it.\n\n
